Version: 1.2.2
Date: 2022-12-29
  Features:
    - Added a station combinator setting to enable or disable the inactivity condition in a train's orders, disabled by default (but not in <=1.2.1 worlds)
    - Added a depot combinator setting to enable depot bypass, enabled by default
    - Added a depot combinator setting to force trains to park at the same depot, enabled by default
    - Added network "each" for depots
    - Added a map setting to modify the default locked slots per cargo wagon value
    - Added a map setting to modify the default priority value
    - Added a map setting to allow trains with cargo at depots, disabled by default
  Changes:
    - Inverted the sign of combinator outputs, a map setting has been added to maintain backwards compatibility with <=1.2.1 worlds
    - Overhauled the wagon control combinator algorithm to spread items out between cargo wagons
    - Trains with cargo held in the depot now check if they have been emptied and reset when they have
    - Cargo capacity is now prioritized over distance when choosing trains
    - Increased the default request threshold to 2000
    - Improved English localization
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug where trains with cargo sometimes weren't getting held at depots
    - Fixed a crash caused by changing a station combinator to the "each" network during a bad tick
    - Fixed a crash when changing a refueler away from network each

Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2022-12-24
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug where sometimes refuelers would reject trains they should accept
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2022-12-23
  Features:
    - Forced provide stations to wait until they can service the highest priority request station
    - Provide stations now override request thresholds with the per-item thresholds set by their station control combinator
    - Allowed station and fuel combinators to be set to network id "each", for each virtual signal they recieve as input, the stop is added to that network and its signal strength is used as the network mask
    - Added the ability to specify per-station whether request thresholds represent total items or total stacks
    - Added more detailed missing train alerts
  Changes:
    - The internal blueprint storage for cybernetic combinators was changed for the sake of future-proofing it for adding more combinator settings to the mod, this unfortunately breaks some existing blueprints
    - Prioritized a train's distance from the provide station over the train's cargo capacity
    - Nonempty trains in depot are no longer put in manual mode, instead they are forced to park at the depot
    - Made several alerts persistent
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed bug with depot priority not working
    - Fixed a memory leak relating to train layouts
    - Fixed a rare crash when building stations
    - Fixed a bug where automatic allow-list sometimes could not be turned off
    - Slightly improved compat with SE thanks to a bugfix in 0.6.94
