# Factorio Library
The Factorio Library is a set of high-quality, commonly-used utilities for
creating Factorio mods.

## Usage

Download the latest release from the
[mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/flib) unzip it, and put it in your
mods directory. You can access libraries provided by flib with
`require("__flib__/event")`, etc.

Add the flib directory to your language server's library and install the
[Factorio LSP plugin](https://github.com/JanSharp/FactorioSumnekoLuaPlugin) to
enable autocomplete and in-line documentation of flib functions.

You can view the legacy online documentation
[here](https://factoriolib.github.io/flib/index.html). Please note that this
documentation is out-of-date, and will be replaced with a new site in the
future.
